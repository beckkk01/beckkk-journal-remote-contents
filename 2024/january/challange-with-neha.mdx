We discuss a lot about money. We don't have very different opinions on this, and we both believe that money can't buy happinessâ€”it can buy crazy-ass happiness. Ummm, whenever we go to the mall, I don't know why we always like expensive things. I know expensive items are usually of good quality, but shouldn't we consider our budget when making choices?

So, this journal is all about the challenge between me and Neha. She always says she's going to earn more money than me. But with no ego, I'm going to make moreâ€”not because of the challenge but because I've always wanted to earn a lot. So much that expensive items should at least seem cheap.

Anyway, a challenge is a challenge.

Tm mere ko Email kri ho, yaad hai na, is challenge ko.

Waise I want you to be more successful than me. Mere se tm 10x kamawo ya 20x. Sb mera he hai.

ðŸ‘‹ _See You Ekka Neha. In Future_.
