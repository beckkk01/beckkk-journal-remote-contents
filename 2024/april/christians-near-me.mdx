When I was born, my parents didn't ask me which religion or Christian denomination I wanted to accept. That wasnâ€™t fair to me. Anyway....

I'm noticing something peculiar in my surroundings.

I don't know what is right or wrong; who am I to judge?

But there are things I need to write to calm my mind.

I've observed a break in the structure of our beliefs.

And that break in structure could be justified.

"Mai idhr Gumla side k context me likh rha hu"

_So these are totally my understanding and thoughts. If someone landed here on this page, please leave.... "Nahi toh mere andr buri aatma, ya saitan hai bologe."_

**Structured and Unstructured Missionaries**

There are missionaries like Roman Catholic, GEL, and other Protestant groups that are very structured and have some rules as well.

In Roman Catholic, it takes more than 8â€“10 years to become a priest.

Palli Prohit(Gumla side), Bishop, Cardinal aur kyaÂ² hota bahut sara....

Bishops aur Cardinal toh pardhe likhe hote like, Phd aur multiple degrees hota inke pass.

On the other hand, I see many prayer groups (Chota Group v inhe sbse influenced hota), some of which are quite large, and these are not affiliated to any Churches. Anyone can start their own group. These are different kind of missionaries. Totally different...

I call them _"kattar Christians"_. Because they believe they are chosen. Everyone here is a preacher. Theology aur Biblical studies jaise subjects pardhne k jarurat nahi.

Sb apna he group bnaye ja rhe...

Bs inhe k baare aaj kuch baat Krna hai...

**1. Healing**

It seems like magicâ€”that prayer krane wala touches, says something in a different language, and people get healed.

Easy peasy...

But it's fine agar genuinely sb thk ho rhe toh, log changa ho rhe aur logo k paap dhul rhe toh...

**2. Different Language**

These groups have one thing in common, they speak different languages while doing prayer.

Some people do it genuinely and happens subconsciously I call this " Ranjha Jana, Lean Ho Jana ", different language wala v same chiz hai.

But nowadays gaali2 me different language wale log milenge and ye fashion bn gya hai.

Jb mai chota tha tb SARNA ASTHAL me "Chattana" dekha tha. That is also "Ranjha Jana". Ekdam prayer me ghuss jana. Avi NY dekha bahut dino se Qki SARNA ASTHAL nahi gya. Aur tb internet v nahi tha ki ye trending chiz ho.

Chalo ye v thk hai agar koi prayer me lean ho ja rha toh.

But I'm sure these kattar Christians me se aadhe log bs pressure me wo sb krte.

Agal bagal dekh k, jaise faddfadana, chillana, gir jana...

**3. Prophecy**

Prophecy toh mera fav hai. " T, T, T aur T naam wale ka Sarkari job lagne wala hai ye saal.

But they are very serious about their prophecy. Aur log andha vishwas krte. Please guys..

_Prophecy sahi hua toh tmne prophecy kri,
Nahi hua toh God has other plans. Wow_ ðŸ˜®

Baat krne k liye bahut kuch hai but ab conclude krta hu...

Problem ye nahi hai ki Money Laundering ho rhi hai. ðŸ¤£ (Choro ye sb)

Problem ye hai ki Gumla side v log kattar Christians bn rhe. Ab Christians jo RC ya GEL wale log hai wo v aise he groups join kr rhe aur aise aajib type se prayer krne lage hai. These Christians people are converting....

_I believe Jesus was a logical and rational thinker._ Ye sb dekhenge toh unhe bura lagega.

Be logical.

Churches me itna acchaÂ² gaana sun ne ko milta. Kitni shaanti hoti, Easter k time ka song compositions.... Aaye haaye...
Christmas ka song compositions.. omg...

Kitna sukkon, ab toh.....

_"Mera yeshu yeshu mera yeshu yeshu"_

Ab toh log chilla rhe, fadfada rhe, saitan ko nikal rhe aur pta nahi kya2. Dekh k ajib lg jata.

Yahi log khud Christianity ko badnam kr rhe illogical chiz sb kr k.

Aur Ha, mai Churches ya Structured Missionaries ka v taarif nY kr rha. Unke baare me v baat Kiya jyega kabhi.

Mai bs aajkal jo trending me hai prayer style usko counter krne k lye example me liya hu.

Structured Missionaries me pardhai hoti hai toh Bible k misinterpretation k chances bahut kam hote. Badha chaddha k updhesh jada nahi dete.

Bahut kuch bol dunga, control.....

**Conformity** - ye word khojÂ² k pareshan ho gya tha mai. Ye mai suna tha but yaad NY aa rha tha. Chalo mil gya.

**Conformity** is a psychological concept where individuals adjust their behavior, beliefs, or actions to align with those of a group due to real or perceived social pressure. This was famously studied in experiments like Asch's conformity experiments. - ( Source Google)

Bs yahi chal rha aajkl. Mere ghar traf v spread ho rha. Ab log Church chor k aise he missionaries me jada believe krne lge hai. 

Chalo koi ny. Sorry rhega Jesus agr ye sb aapko sahi lgta toh. But aur ek sorry qki merko ye sb accha ny lg rha. 

Merko mera karm se Judge Krna. Please. ðŸ¥º 

Raha meri baat ðŸ˜Ž...
