Throughout December, I was asked why I broke up with my girlfriend.

I didn't have clear answers, so I told them...

_"Mutual understanding hone k baad breakup hua."_

I don't know what they know and I donâ€™t care because whatever they heard might be half the truth, and a half-truth is a whole lie.

_"Baat teesra person se aage gya mtlb wo baat he change ho gyi samjho."_

I see her through a different lens and my friends through different lenses. Aur pta kya? What we interpret is totally influenced by our past experiences and thoughts.

Sayed jo reality hai wo sabke lye alag hai.

Reality can be subjective, shaped by individual perceptions. We can never perceive it directly. Instead, we filter it through our minds, then we experience it.

Do they need to know the reason? No...

We aren't together. That's it.

Ask us how beautifully we handled.

No toxicity, no fights, no misunderstanding, no miscommunication, no hurting... aur kya chahiye breakup se phle.

Laarai jhagra 2 months ka???

I'm happy because moments and memories are still beautiful.

_Only an individual knows their reality._

We know ours.
