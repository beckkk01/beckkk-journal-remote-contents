In June 2025, I'll be turning 25, and I'm still wondering what I want to do with my life.

WTF, _mai Jinda Q hu._

**2024 review in few words..**

This year, I tried many things like going to the gym, reading, studying, and writing a journal, but I couldn’t stick to any of them. Still, 2024 was a great year because I genuinely tried to change myself.

It was one of the best years of my life as I experienced so many things: love, care, betrayal, anxiety, depression, empathy, sympathy and so much more.

I hope I can restart and achieve my goals.

Sala ek diary bnaya tha mere aur meri Ex k lye, bahut kuch likha tha. Meri maa ne dekh aur pardh liya. Laaj lga tha jun.

So, I'm thinking ki ab pen paper pe bs wo feelings likhunga jo kisiko btana ny chahta, phir destroy kr dunga.

Baaki bakwas I'm going to write here on this digital journal, jo maine khud design aur code kr k bnaya tha 2023 me. Ab ye kaam aayega.

Pahle ka sb posts delete kr deta hu.

Needs modifications, phir aur v kuch² custom feature add kr dunga.

I take oath ki ek² chiz ka hisaab rakhunga ye saal.

Kitna kharcha kaha kr rha, kitna time study kra, kitna mstrbsn kra, har ek chiz.

I need my data to understand me. 

_Huhuhuh...._

So, I'm welcoming 2025 without any expectations because I’ll do everything I thought I’d do in 2024.

_"Sala jb v life ko seriously leta hu kuch na kuch kaand ho jata hai."_

Dear 2025 I'm not serious, okay..

Welcome...., Happy New Year.

Chal ab 2024 ka kaam pura krne...
