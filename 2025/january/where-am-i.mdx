Where am I?  
Feels like I’m imprisoned.  
Where am I?  
I can’t see the horizon.  
Where am I?  
What happened to my vision?  
Where am I?  
The last thing I remember was love’s division.

Where am I?  
After my love’s gone.  
Where am I?  
Drifting through nights so long.  
Where am I?  
In shadows where dreams don’t belong.  
Where am I?  
Can’t escape; I’m not that strong.

Where am I?  
Feels like I’m floating in the dark.  
Where am I?  
Am I falling apart?  
Where am I?  
Tell me, my dear heart.  
Where am I?  
Can’t escape; I’m not that smart.
