I want to get drunk and crawl,  
I want to vomit these thoughts.  
If I blackout and I'm far from home.  
Would you carry me home?  

I don’t want to be sober,  
Everything feels like it’s over.  
If I'm down and all alone  
Would you carry me home?  

I want to feel what it’s like to be missed,  
I want to feel what it’s like to be kissed,  
When I won't respond and I'm gone.  
Would you carry me my real home?
